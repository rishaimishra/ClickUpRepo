						<h4>What does the eUpClick Privacy Policy cover?</h4>
									
<p>his Privacy Policy covers (i) the use and retention of personally identifiable information (“PII”) that eUpClick, LLC (“eUpClick”) collects from our customers and visitors to the webpages on earthlink.net, related subdomains and their pages (collectively, “eUpClick Communication Channels” including Website, Mobile App and Phone) and (ii) your options with regard to that collection and use. The eUpClick Communication Channels and the services and products offered on or through the eUpClick Communication Channels are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “eUpClick Services”. eUpClick is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your PII and will not share, sell or license your PII except in very limited circumstances as described below. All PII collected by eUpClick including, but not limited to, via the Internet, via any eUpClick mobile application, via mail or over the telephone is protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party websites that you may link to from the eUpClick Website or information collected by advertising networks on third party websites. Any information you provide to third party websites is subject to the third party websites’ privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage you to read the third party websites’ privacy policies and terms of service before using these third party websites. eUpClick is not responsible for the content, services, products or applications provided by or through third party websites.<br><br>

If you post any comments to any of the public areas of the eUpClick channels such as eUpClick’s Facebook page or eUpClick’s Twitter account, your comments can be read or used by others and any PII that you post in such public areas could be used by others to contact you or for other purposes. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information in these public areas. eUpClick is not responsible for any PII you choose to submit through the public areas of the eUpClick Channels, third party websites or social networking services. </p>

<h4>How eUpClick uses your PII</h4>
<p>eUpClick uses your PII to (i) provide your eUpClick Services to you, (ii) establish and manage your customer account and billing records, (iii) contact you about your customer account including your eUpClick Services and other products and services that we offer or that we offer in conjunction with an affiliate company, (iv) provide you with additional information that may be of interest to you such as news about eUpClick, (v) resolve billing problems, (vi) provide customized technical support, (vii) monitor your eUpClick Services, (viii) monitor and protect our network, (ix) protect against fraudulent, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of the eUpClick Services, (x) provide customized personal start pages, and (xi) administer surveys.
<br><br>
If you apply online for a position at eUpClick, we will only use the information you provide for job recruitment and other customary human resources purposes.<br><br>

eUpClick may supplement your PII with information received from publicly available sources, such as demographic information, to help us develop and improve the eUpClick Services and to send marketing offers to you that may be of interest to you. </p>

<h4>What is PII?</h4>
<p>Information you provide in connection with your purchase of or subscription to eUpClick Services including your name, mailing and/or shipping address (when combined with your name), telephone number, email address, and credit card number.<br><br>
Transaction and activity information about your eUpClick Services; your customer account and billing records; your interactions with our customer service and/or technical support representatives over the telephone, email or through online chat.</p>

<h4>How eUpClick protects the Security of PII?</h4>	
<p>eUpClick has implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to safeguard your PII and non-personally identifiable information. We use industry standards to secure PII when it is being collected and transmitted over the Internet as well as firewalls, security monitoring, encryption and intrusion detection software. Although we cannot guarantee that our information security program will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose your PII, we maintain security and incident response practices to handle incidents involving unauthorized access, use or disclosure of your PII.<br><br>

Under our practices and policies, access to PII is authorized only for eUpClick employees and contractors who have a business need for such access, and records are retained in accordance with applicable laws and then securely destroyed. eUpClick employees and contractors are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use of and disclosure of PII.<br><br>

As an extra precaution, you should not share your password with anyone. eUpClick will only ask you for your password as part of a customer service or technical support call or online chat, and only in cases where you request customer support to access your account information or you request customer service or technical support in connection with the eUpClick Services. </p>
<h4>Sharing of PII in Limited Circumstances</h4>
<p>When eUpClick uses third parties to perform business functions on our behalf, we require them through contracts to treat your PII confidentially and to only use your PII for the express purpose of providing the specific business functions for eUpClick. Examples of such third parties include, but are not limited to: (i) merchant banks for credit card authorizations, (ii) collection agencies, (iii) customer service companies, and (iv) market research companies.<br><br>

Some eUpClick Services are offered to eUpClick customers in conjunction with a third-party vendor. To provide these services, the vendor may need to collect and retain your PII but the vendor will be required by contract with eUpClick to maintain the confidentiality of your PII.<br><br>

If ownership of eUpClick changes, including as a result of a merger, acquisition, or the sale of its assets, your PII may be transferred or assigned as part of the transferred assets. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your PII, we will notify you about the material change. </p>

<h4>Use of Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies</h4>
<p>eUpClick uses cookies and anonymous identifiers to collect certain non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) about you when you use the eUpClick Services. A cookie is a small text file that websites send to your computer, tablet, mobile device or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. An anonymous identifier is a random string of characters that is used for the same purposes as a cookie on platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology is not available.<br><br>

This Non-PII does not identify you personally, but includes technical information such as your Internet Protocol or IP address, operating system, and browsing and linking activity while using the eUpClick Services. eUpClick uses cookies to authenticate you and save your settings on your personal start page so that we can provide you with customized and personalized content and services. eUpClick uses anonymous identifiers to monitor browsing and linking activity throughout the eUpClick Services.<br><br>

eUpClick also uses advertising networks that customize and serve third party advertisements or other content on the eUpClick Website. The servers of these advertising networks place and access cookies and similar technologies in browsers to collect Non-PII information about your visits to the eUpClick Website. These kinds of tracking and analytics are done in the aggregate and are anonymous. </p>
<h4>International Visitors</h4>
<p>Your PII will be processed and maintained by us in compliance with this Privacy Policy and United States data protection and privacy laws and regulations. If you create an account to use an eUpClick Service and/or are using the eUpClick Website as a visitor from outside the United States, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer and processing of all your PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy and United States data protection and privacy laws, which many not offer an equivalent level of protection to the laws in the European Union or certain other countries. </p>
<h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>From time to time, eUpClick may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new or different privacy practices. You will be able to see that changes have been made by checking the effective date and endnotes at the end of this Privacy Policy that explain what has been revised.<br><br>

In addition, if any of the revisions to this Privacy Policy will materially affect the way we use, disclose or retain previously-collected PII, we will provide notification in advance of change. </p>
